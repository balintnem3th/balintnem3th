# Corsac Orientation Retake Exam

The programmer's most important equipment is his/her laptop and Murphy's law says "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".
We have to maintain our computer, and sometimes external help needed to fix a problem.
Let's create an error ticket system to help ourself.

## Highlights

 -  It has a frontend which can:
     -  list all the tickets with details
     -  save new error reports

Detailed info is in the language specific description.

## Getting Started

 -  Fork this repository under your own account
 -  Clone the forked repository to your computer 
 -  Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 -  All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

## What can I use?

 -  You can use any resource online, but **work individually**
 -  Instead of copy-pasting your answers and solutions, write them in your own words.

## Tasks for everybody

### 1) Import the database

All classes should import the following database:

| java | c# | javascript |
|-----|-----|-----|
|[java.sql](assets/java.sql)|[cs.sql](assets/cs.sql)|[js.sql](assets/js.sql)|

CREATE A SCREENSHOT OF THE DATABASE YOU IMPORTED AND COMMIT IT TO THE REPO

### 2) Continue with your class' language:
